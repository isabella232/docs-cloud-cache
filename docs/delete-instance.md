title: Deleting a Service Instance
---

You can delete service instances using the cf CLI. Before doing so, you must remove any existing service keys and app bindings.

1. Run `cf delete-service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME KEY-NAME` to delete the service key.
1. Run `cf unbind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to unbind your app from the service instance.
1. Run `cf delete-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to delete the service instance.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf delete-service-key my-cloudcache my-service-key
$ cf unbind-service my-app my-cloudcache
$ cf delete-service my-cloudcache
</pre>

Deletions are asynchronous. Run `cf services` to view the current status of the service instance deletion.
