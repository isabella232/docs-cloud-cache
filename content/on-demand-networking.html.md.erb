This section describes networking considerations for Pivotal Cloud Cache.

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must ensure network 
rules are set up so that connections are open as described in the table below.

## <a id ="WAN_details"></a>PCC Instances Across WAN

PCC service instances running within distinct PCF foundations
may communicate with each other across a WAN.
In a topology such as this,
the members within one service instance use their own private address space,
as defined in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918).

A VPN may be used to connect the private network spaces that lay
across the WAN.
The steps required to enable the connectivity by VPN are dependent
on the IaaS provider(s).

The private address space for each service instance's network
must be configured with non-overlapping CIDR blocks.
Configure the network prior to creating service instances.
Locate directions for creating a network on the appropriate IAAS provider
within the section titled
[Architecture and Installation Overview](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html).
